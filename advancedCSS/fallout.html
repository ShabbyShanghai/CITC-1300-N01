        <aside><h2>Fallout 1 and 2</h2>
        <p>Fallout 1&2 are practically the same game with 2 just improving upon the mechanics from Fallout 1 (to the point where fans remade the first in the second game). Fallout 1 maintained the western RPG asthetic while improving upon it, some examples of western RPGs of the time are D&D, Wasteland, Cyberpunk, etc. While people of now may prefer the simplified versions of RPGs instead of elaborate sytems that take time to learn; many of the complaints about older WRPGS such as Fallout is that they're "too hard" and "complicated" while praising newer games such as Balders Gate III. Bethesda, the now current holders of the Fallout license have handeled it so poorly that it is genuinely sad to see the state that the newer games are in (such as 76.)</p>
        <p>The story in the original Fallout games are so elaborate and have no open ends, and it makes the world feel lived in; which is EXTREMELY important in a RPG. The ambient tracks in the games have their own tid-bits that also make the game both feel alive and dreadful, such as the intercoms from Vault of the Future and Metallic Monks horns. The character creation meets a perfect point of being too complex and being too simple. It introduces many new mechanics never seen in other games, such as S.P.E.C.I.A.L, Tag skills, and traits(kinda...) Fallout 1 does have it's faults though, such as no take all button or how slow it is to barter; thankfully Fallout 2 added those and various other improvements. In conclusion, Fallout 1 and 2 are basically the same game with 2 having improvements, but that's not a bad thing; "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." The games are sadly becoming irrelevent with Bethesda retconning everything from them (I.E. vertibirds being post-war, power armor having an unlimited fuel source, the location of Shady Sands, etc.) but they're still worth playing if you like isometric turn-based RPGs nontheless.</p>
